      "The raptors in sector 32 attempted to break out at about 10 AM this morning. Proposed solution: Increase the height of the fence by additional 3 feet, and upgrade the monitoring system in that sector.",
      "I've ordered in a new shipment of fence wires, fence poles and fence bases, as well as sufficient redstone to power the system. The raptors will need to be sedated while the new adjustments are implemented."

      "One of the workers reported a leak in Coelacanth nursery tank number 5. The fault appears to be with the type of glass being used. The glass needs to be supported with reinforced metal borders, in order to withstand the strain of the water pressure.",

      "As our T. rex grows larger, the barrier of her enclosure will need renovations. I've designed enclosures for elephants and other large mammals at Mojang Zoo, but I think even that design of barrier may be insufficient to contain something so damn big!",
      "Strong stone walls, reinforced with a sort of metal endoskeleton, may be the answer. These walls will then be topped off with the standard redstone-powered electric fencing, supported by fence poles approximately 20 feet tall. These security measures should be enough to keep visitors safe. At least, in theory."

      "The Microraptors keep escaping their enclosure! Like Velociraptors, their intelligence makes them devious and unpredictable, and due to their small size and dark coloration, finding them is not easy. Muldoon once told me that tracking Microraptors is \"like playing hide and seek with a clan of ninjas\".",
      "Their ability to both climb and glide also came as a surprise. Therefore, the whole flock is being contained at an indoor containment facility until their whole enclosure can be roofed off and converted into an aviary.",
