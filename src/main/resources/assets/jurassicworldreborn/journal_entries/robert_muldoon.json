      "Hammond insisting on having cows ready to feed to the raptors just to impress the visitors. Keep trying to tell him it's encouraging unnatural feeding behaviour, but he accuses me of being too cautious and laughs it off. He has become more headstrong since he took on the Site A park.",
      "",
      "Have proposed to him that, if we are to keep raptors rather than destroy them, we must house them in open paddocks, like big cats. I saw the same kind of frustration and pacing in the lions at the safari park, before we moved them to the new plains enclosure. He followed the advice then, but now he refuses. He prefers the aesthetic of their cage."

They recommend first restraining the animal, and then darting it with a specialized morphine-based formula enhanced with trace amounts of redstone. Interesting idea. Like to see them restraining Rexy."
