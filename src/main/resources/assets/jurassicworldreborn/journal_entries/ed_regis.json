      "The park's security seems to be top notch, with vast stretches of electric fence everywhere. Saw some dinosaurs on my way in, these massive great big fat things with really long necks. Brontosaurus? Brancheatingsaurus? It's been years since I last watched the Flintstones. Tourists will love them, I'm sure."

I didn't see anyone there, but I didn't have long to think about that, as at that moment I felt a sharp pain in my foot. This little green dinosaur - 'Computersaurus' or something like that - latched onto my ankle like a pitbull! Luckily I was able to get the little bastard off me, and my wound was treated and dressed at the infirmary.",

      "I take back what I said in my previous entries. This park has some serious security issues! Yes, the dinosaur that attacked me was only about the size of a chicken, but what if next time it's something larger and more dangerous? Although I'm reluctant to do so, I will mention this to Mr. Hammond, as this is a lawsuit waiting to happen."

Also heard something about an argument between Dr. Wu and Dr. Sorkin, although I'm not clear on the details of that. Therefore I'm going to wait to bring up my security concerns to Mr. Hammond for now.",
